# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients. The model is based on logistic regression, a popular statistical method used for binary classification problems. The primary goal is to identify key factors that contribute to heart disease and to develop a predictive model that can be used for early diagnosis and intervention.

Dataset:
  The dataset used in this project contains various health-related metrics that are indicative of heart disease. Some of the key features include:

- **Age**: The age of the patient.
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female).
- **Chest Pain Type**: Type of chest pain experienced by the patient (4 types).
- **Resting Blood Pressure**: The patientâ€™s resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).
- **Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
- **Fasting Blood Sugar**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false).
- **Resting ECG Results**: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2).
- **Max Heart Rate Achieved**: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
- **Exercise-Induced Angina**: Whether the patient experienced exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).
- **Oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment**: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
- **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
- **Thalassemia**: Thalassemia status (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect).

To run the notebook and reproduce the results, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
